** _notes_
** _done_
*** draw the corners, show the image and flush on each iteration
*** why sometimes 3 pushes
    - happened when find corners failed, we didn't show and prev push wasn't nuked
*** why are some imgs showing green background
*** find corners fails for some calibration images (5,1,4)
*** implement sobel
**** _notes_
**** _done_
***** adapt code from lesson to save imgs
****** _done_
******* get it to work w/hardcoded parms
******* add hyperparms to gpd
******* save the image to the viewer
******* think about using saver to save the stuff we display in the viewer(@least on flush)
******* how to enforce input to sobel is gray scale?(#chans?)
******** _done_
******** maybe control this via gpd
****** xx
***** go back to dir_thresh & try Lesson 6.7 combining thresholds

******* nuke debug_sobel and below
******* clean up lane_finding_take_1
****** implement combining thresholds
******* _done_
******** implement hls thresh
******* hack the current 3 threshold fns to return the grad_binary, mag_binary, dir_binary in output arg
******* implement combined
******* put blank line b4 hls call in advLaneFinding_take1

**** get it to run afap
***** _done_
**** create a new file just for this w/none of my code involved and see iff it works
**** separate it into demo.py
**** fling into git
**** 

*** move the globbing up to level above calibrate_camera
*** choose glob or just one for speed
** settle on thresholded binary image
