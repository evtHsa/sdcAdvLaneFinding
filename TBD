** _notes_
** _done_
*** draw the corners, show the image and flush on each iteration
*** why sometimes 3 pushes
    - happened when find corners failed, we didn't show and prev push wasn't nuked
*** why are some imgs showing green background
*** find corners fails for some calibration images (5,1,4)
